Note: If you're using a 3M Virtual Machine, it's possible some of the products to install may exist already. Products to Install Please install the following products in the order listed below. Click the project name to open the specific steps for each product below. Wherever relevant, OS specific steps will be provided for both Mac and PC. I would like to also point out that we are not allowed to be admins on our 3M machines, we use elevated access. This is accomplished by right clicking and selecting the elevated access option. Note: Install Issues not specifically addressed in the specific product install guides below should be recorded here. Since we have moved into an open source environment for Odin it is not unreasonable to use our own machines for dev. Sometimes this proves less restrictive and has better up-time. Product Install Guides (by install order) Virtualization (only necessary if developing on Windows) .NET Core 3.1 PowerShell Azure CLI (plus extensions) Visual Studio Code Git / Bash NodeJS / npm Visual Studio 2019 Azure Data Studio Storage Explorer Azure IoT Explorer Docker Terraform Kubernetes HelmRedux Postman Source Code"

    "keywords": "OVERVIEW Purpose This document outlines instructions on how we should collectively create detailed installation instructions on setting up a development environment to support 3M's Bluebird IoT platform. See Project Information for details about the engagement. The end result will be given back to 3M to serve as a more comprehensive setup guide then the list of products they provided us. Each of us have different backgrounds and will consequently have unique experience during setup. The more comprehensive we can make this by incorporating all that we run into the better it will be.

    "keywords": "Overview If your development environment runs on Windows you must setup virtualization in order to run docker containers locally since some of them run on Linux which Windows does not natively support. This is not necessary on a MacOS since it's based on Unix. Which virtualization product you use is a matter of preference and is typically influence by the OS of your host machine. Historically, Hyper-V was popular for servers and VirtualBox on clients. Virtualization Product PRODUCT VENDOR GUIDES Hyper-V Microsoft MS Install Guide Virtual Box Oracle - Docker for Mac - Using Docker with Virutal Box on Windows Prepare Virtual Machine using Hyper-V Enable Hyper-V. Click for more details . Create a Virtual Machine. Click for more details . Note: Microsoft offers instances of Ubuntu and an evaluation copy of Windows. Currently the evaluation only last 5 days so it's not a great option unless you have an Win 10 Enterprise Key to use to upgrade. Otherwise you need an ISO and License Key for the OS you intend to install. Using the eval requires a 16GB download. Prepare Installation Media Create Virtual Machine Prepare Installation Media If you're going to use your own copy of an operating system, you need to first create an ISO so Hyper-V or VirtualBox can use it to build the Virtual Machine. Microsoft provides a useful tool called Create Windows 10 installation media that can be downloaded here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 . The link includes instructions on how to use. The above approach can also be used for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7. Alternatively there are several open source and 3rd party products that can be used to create ISO. Create Virtual Machine Once you have your ISO, you can start the create virtual machine process. To continue, follow these steps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine Alternative As untried alternative to virtualization, if you're using Windows you could try the Linux subsystem for Windows. Note: We have not tried this. Key consideration is whether or not docker images can be instantiated. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux for production: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows#use-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-production The Windows Subsystem for Linux, introduced in the Anniversary Update , became a stable feature in the Fall Creators Update . You can now run Ubuntu and openSUSE on Windows, with Fedora and more Linux distributions coming soon. This documented might be a good guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-10-Client"
