# Bluebird - 3M Azure Platforms and Tooling

This is the documentation source for the Bluebird project inside of 3M. This project is maintained by the Corporate Research System Lab (CRSL). In addition to CRSL this project is closely collaborated on with both the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE) and IT Security teams.

The goal of the project is to create platforms and automation tooling for the Microsoft Azure cloud.

This project leverages Inner-Source and Open-Source to be successful. No single team inside of 3M has the ability to maintain, advance, and contribute to a project like this. If you are interested in contributing or are unfamiliar with these concepts please see the documentation site here:
