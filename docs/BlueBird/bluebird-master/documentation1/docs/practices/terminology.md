## Definitions

A shared language is one of the most important agreements when collaborating across teams. These are a set of definitions and shared terminology that will help explain what Bluebird is and is not compared to other 3M environments and processes:

![Bluebird Terminology](../assets/images/bluebird-terminology.png)

* **Bluebird Cloud Request and Environment**: An extension to the CCOE Cloud Request that creates four isolated Azure Subscriptions (Dev=Development, QA=Quality Assurance, CT=Customer Test and Prod=Production) and an Azure DevOps Project. The standard CCOE request provides a single subscription or resource group dependant on business needs. This extension to the standard request allows for a more mature DevOps process and isolated customer test (CT) and production environments for compliance with certain regulatory standards.
* **Bluebird Tools**: A central Azure DevOps organization where your Bluebird project lives that is maintained by the Corporate Research Systems Lab (CRSL). This gives you access to a large pool of build minutes, shared standards, extensions, Azure Boards customizations for enhanced Scrum at Scale and quick start guides (like this one!), examples and resources to get you up to speed. You can leverage these tools to move cloud resources or platforms using DevOps best practices between subscriptions
* **Bluebird Platform**: A set of native cloud resources, custom 3M and open source code and deployment scripts that can be leveraged inside any Bluebird Environment to solve and support common but complex initiatives inside of 3M. These platforms are pre-screened by Information Security Risk & Compliance (ISRC), built on top of industry best practices and architecture principles to reduce time to market, cost and complexity. The core platforms are maintained and enhanced by CRSL to stay compliant and meet different business needs while keeping up with Azure cloud new features and enhancements.
* **Bluebird Deployment**: A deployed instance of a Bluebird platform that is instantiated in the customer's subscription structure.
* **Bluebird Workbench**: A deployed instance of a Bluebird platform that can be leveraged to test platform features such as device connectivity, AI model creation, or simple infrastructure deployments. This is different from a deployment as CRSL manages the instance and infrastructure.
