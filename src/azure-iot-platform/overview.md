Remote monitoring helps you get better visibility into your devices, assets, and
sensors wherever they happen to be located. You can collect and analyze real-time
device data using a remote monitoring solution that triggers automatic alerts and
actions â€” from remote diagnostics to maintenance requests. You can also command and
control your devices.
