# OVERVIEW

### Purpose

This document outlines instructions on how we should collectively create detailed installation instructions on setting up a development environment to support 3M's Bluebird IoT platform.  See Project Information for details about the engagement.  The end result will be given back to 3M to serve as a more comprehensive setup guide then the list of products they provided us. 
Each of us have different backgrounds and will consequently have unique experience during setup.  The more comprehensive we can make this by incorporating all that we run into the better it will be.
