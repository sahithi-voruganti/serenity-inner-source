## Use extensions with Azure CLI

The Azure CLI offers the capability to load extensions. Extensions are Python wheels that aren't shipped as part of the CLI but run as CLI commands. With extensions, you gain access to experimental and pre-release commands along with the ability to write your own CLI interfaces.
